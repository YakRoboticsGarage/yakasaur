# Onboarding / Ladder Modularity

One challenge for iterating towards a final desert capable yaksaur is the duration from project start to final deployment. 
This can be frustrating since many in the Yak Rover project have little experience in robotics.

The following describes a "Ladder" methodology where team members can start with an off-the-shelf kit and iteratively replace parts.
In this way, a functional Rover and development platform can be available for the duration of the project.

**Note: This is distinct from the "breadboard" project which recommends the Freenove ESP32 board to start with. 
That is focused mainly on the compute capabilities for accelerating software development.**

## 1 - The Kit

Build the kit, following along the provided instructions.

## ? - Next Steps

Proposed next steps to be validated as team members reach this stage:

* Replace compute with ESP32-S3 Nano (likely pin compatible)
* Charge with Solar
* Operate over Wifi / Yak Software Stack.
* Blues Wireless for comms
* ...
